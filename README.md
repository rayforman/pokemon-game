Description:
- This mobile device oriented unity project is similar to Pokemon, in the sense that a player walks 
  around a world attempting to catch creatures by getting close to them, however they respond with 
  attacks of their own. The goal is to catch at least one of each creature before losing all five
  hearts from attacking creatures.

Problems:
- Most errors included building, dealing with collisions, and controlling the varioius UI's.
  Also struggled to generalize movement to various creatures with different moving patterns,
  especially with the fishes.

Free Assets Used:
- Fantasy Skybox Free
- Lowpoly Environment Package
- Handpainted Grass & Ground Textures
- Simple Buoy pokemon-game
