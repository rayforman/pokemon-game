#### Game Description:
- This mobile device oriented unity project is similar to Pokemon, in the sense that a player walks around a world attempting to catch various creatures, including fish, bugs, and flies. In order to catch them, the player must enter a visible capture rangeâ€” but when entered creatures respond with attacks of their own. The goal is to catch at least one of each creature in order to win. A health system is implemented allowing 5 hearts, with each received attack from the creatures deducting a heart. Losing occurs when the player loses all five lives.

##### Problems:
- Most development challenges included dealing with collisions, fine tuning rigid-body physics (for projectiles), and controlling the various UI's. Also struggled to generalize movement to various creatures with different moving patterns, especially with the fish which exhibit revolution, spring-like bobbing, and periodic flipping. Reconciling this complex motion with the capture range proved challenging.
